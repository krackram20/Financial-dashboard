# Financial-dashboard (Personal Project)

Financial dashboard created in R with shiny and deployed in shinyapps.io. Here is the link to the dashboard https://krrrr.shinyapps.io/Financial_Dashboard/

Check YTD  prices and financials of any stock in the SPY500. (Current prices are delayed)

DCF calculator.
Simple Markowtiz portfolio weights optimization. (SPY500 only)

Note: The dashboard is not 100% finished, there are some changes that still need to be made.

The data is retrieved from yahoo finance via quantmod and tidyquant, and  the financials are scrapped from WSJ.
